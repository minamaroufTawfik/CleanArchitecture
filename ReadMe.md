# Domain Driven Design (DDD).

There are four fundamental layers of a Domain Driven Based Solution

## Business Logic
Places into two layers, the Domain layer and the Application Layer,
while they contain different kinds of business logic;
### Domain Layer
implements the core, use-case independent business logic of the domain/system.
### Application Layer
implements the use cases of the application based on the domain. A use case can be
thought as a user interaction on the User Interface (UI).

## Presentation Layer
contains the UI elements (pages, components) of the application.
## Infrastructure Layer
supports other layer by implementing the abstractions and integrations to 3rd-party library and systems.
